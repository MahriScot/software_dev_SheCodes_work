      Front-end developer from Edinburgh, Scotland
    </h3>

      <p>
        It has taken me a long time to find the tech industry but I am so glad I
        have.
        <br />
        <br />
        I graduated with a BSc (hons) in Business Studies and Psychology in 2010
        and have since travelled a lot of the world, working, volunteering,
        exploring, and learning as I go. Working as a driver guide in Scotland
        upon my return kept my curious and adventurous mind busy - it was
        wonderful to share all my knowledge with passengers from every country
        of the world as I led them around my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the pandemic hit, I worked in a care home, completed a masters at
        the University of Edinburgh in Psychology of Mental Health, achieving a
        distinction, and joined taster sessions in software development. This
        led me to joining SheCodes workshops, where we work with JavaScript,
        CSS, and HTML, and also to my discovery of data analysis. I have now
        completed an incredibly interesting (and fun!) 14 week intensive course
        in data analysis with CodeClan in Edinburgh, Scotland. Whilst there, I
        worked mostly in R whilst learning to clean datasets, analyse them in a
        number of ways, and present our findings on dashboards and during
        presentations. I also gained experience of working with SQL and Python
        and am excited for what the future may hold for me.
