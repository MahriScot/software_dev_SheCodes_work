    <h1>Lesson 1 - CSS Media Queries</h1>
    <p>
      e.g. When you want to center the h1 only on small resolutions (aka mobile
      devices)
    </p>
    <p>
      you can use css - text-align: center
      <br />
      or put CSS Queries at the top of style.css using e.g. @media (min-width:
      400px) {apply css}
      <br />
      but max-width is better e.g.
      <br />
      @media (max-width: 600px) {
      <br />
      h4 { text-align: left;
      <br />
      color: red; } }
<br />
<h4>this is an h4 and it will turn red, become centered, and bigger font size, with smaller resolution</h4>
    it's quite good to use max-width 800 or 900px as it will cover most mobile/ ipad devices, but it depends what you're doing. 
    <br/>
    if you want to hide something on small devices:
<h3>
this h3 is not super important so we might want to simply not show it on a mobile device so we can hide it in @media (max-width: 800px) {h3 {display: none;}}  
</h3>
you can change anything - font size, colours, etc etc etc </p>
<p>we can also use bootstrap - obviously download the appropriate CSS bootstrap link. and in the html we can have h2 class:"d-none d-sm-block" which means it won't display your h2 unless it's bigger than `small`
    <br/>
    or you can have h2 class="d-block d-sm-none" which will hide what you have if the device is `small` or more
 <br/> <br/>
you know which order to do this in as you start with the smallest resolution option on the left (e.g d-block if you want it on your smallest resolution), and then go bigger</p>
<h2>LESSON ONE CHALLENGE </h2>

    <h1>Lesson 2 - Live Server</h1>
    <p>This is an extension on VSCode where you can go live and see updates to your page without refreshing. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With links - remember we use ../ to go back a folder. 
        <br/>
        From now WHEN USING A SERVER, we can use `/` to go back to the main page, e.g. index.html. 
        <br/>
        And use `/about.html` will first take us back home and then to our about page.
        <br/> Using `/` won't work on your test page when you stop the server running so remember this!  
    </p>
    <h1> Lesson 3 - Multiple Page Hosting</h1>
    <p>
Hosting online using Netlify and Github
    </p>
    <p>
        Static Website - frontend/client-side website. What we're working on with HTML, CSS, JS iQuerey, React, Angular JS etc. 
        <br/>
        This will lead to a UI (User Interface) so people can interact with your website. 
    </p>
    <p>Dynamic Website - the same idea but adds a new layer called the server-side/backend
        <br/>
        It needs a database and uses other packages like Python, MySQL, postgres etc. It stores data e.g. usernames/passwords etc and sends this data to the front-end. Using CSS, JS, HTML etc it will render the information based on what the backend/api is sending
    </p>
    <h4>Netlify</h4>
    <p>Commit your changes to your github then create new project on netlify - search for what you named your project and netlify will pull all the files from github and publish. Any changes you push to github will automatically identify this and deploy your changes</p>
