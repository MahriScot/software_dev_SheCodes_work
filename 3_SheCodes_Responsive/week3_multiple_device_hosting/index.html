    <h1>Lesson 1 - CSS Media Queries</h1>
    <p>
      e.g. When you want to center the h1 only on small resolutions (aka mobile
      devices)
    </p>
    <p>
      you can use css - text-align: center
      <br />
      or put CSS Queries at the top of style.css using e.g. @media (min-width:
      400px) {apply css}
      <br />
      but max-width is better e.g.
      <br />
      @media (max-width: 600px) {
      <br />
      h4 { text-align: left;
      <br />
      color: red; } }
<br />
<h4>this is an h4 and it will turn red, become centered, and bigger font size, with smaller resolution</h4>
    it's quite good to use max-width 800 or 900px as it will cover most mobile/ ipad devices, but it depends what you're doing. 
    <br/>
    if you want to hide something on small devices:
<h3>
this h3 is not super important so we might want to simply not show it on a mobile device so we can hide it in @media (max-width: 800px) {h3 {display: none;}}  
</h3>
you can change anything - font size, colours, etc etc etc </p>
<p>we can also use bootstrap - obviously download the appropriate CSS bootstrap link. and in the html we can have h2 class:"d-none d-sm-block" which means it won't display your h2 unless it's bigger than `small`
    <br/>
    or you can have h2 class="d-block d-sm-none" which will hide what you have if the device is `small` or more
 <br/> <br/>
you know which order to do this in as you start with the smallest resolution option on the left (e.g d-block if you want it on your smallest resolution), and then go bigger</p>
